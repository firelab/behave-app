* Finding VMS elements in the Application

The VMS holds the structure of our application. The data is a tree like structure that determines how the application is rendered. This section aims to help you understand how the data in the VMS translates to how it is shown in the application.

** Modules/Submodules/Groups/Group Variables

In the VMS Use the side bar to navigate down these paths:

#+begin_verse
Applications \to Modules \to Submodules \to Group \to Group Variables \to Variables
#+end_verse

Example:

#+begin_verse
BehavePlus \to Surface \to Fire Behavior(output) \to Surface Fire \to Heading Rate of Spread \to Heading Rate of Spread
#+end_verse

** Variables

The Variables can be associated with multiple group variables but group variables can only be associated to a single variable. The Variable entity will hold information about Domains/Dimension/units

*** Variable Entities

1. Navigate to the "Variables" tab

*** Variable Associated with a Group Variable

1. Navigate to the Application \to Module \to Group
2. "Expand" the "Variables" accordion
3. Find the variable you are interested in and click "Edit". This will take you to the "Variables" page and populate the form with the variable's info.

** List and List Options

Certain Group Variables have a list associated with it (usually inputs). In the application lists show up as either radio selections or drop down selections.

** Variable Domains
*** Variable Domain Entities

The Variable Domain entities is used primarily to associate a group of variables to some default units and decimal precision. Domain entities are grouped into Domain sets, primarily used for creating collapsing accordions in the application.

#+ATTR_LATEX: :placement [H]
#+CAPTION: Application: Custom Unit Preferences table.
[[./images/vms-guide/Screenshot 2025-04-16 152012.png]]

1. Navigate to the "Variable Domains" tab
2. Click "Edit" on the "Domain Set". This will populate the form on the right with a list of domains that belong to this set.
#+ATTR_LATEX: :placement [H]
#+CAPTION: VMS: Variable Domains.
[[./images/vms-guide/Screenshot 2025-04-16 152830.png]]

*** Variable Domains Associated with a Group Variable

1. Find the Variable associated with your group variable of interest. see [[*Variable Associated with a Group Variable][Variable Associated with a Group Variable]] section
2. You can find the domain associated to the variable under the "Domain" field

#+ATTR_LATEX: :placement [H]
#+CAPTION: VMS: The Domain associated with this variable.
[[./images/vms-guide/Screenshot 2025-04-16 160738.png]]

** Units and Precision

Default Units and Precision live in the Domain Entities.

1. Find the Domain associated with your group variable see [[*Variable Domains Associated with a Group Variable][Variable Domains Associated with a Group Variable]] section.
2. Navigate to the "Domains" page and lookup the domain.
3. Click "Edit" on the "Domain Set" and "Edit" on the "Domain" entity to populate the forms.
4. Default units is shown under "Native Unit"
5. Default precision is shown under "Decimals"

** Conditionals

Conditionals serve one of two purposes. First and most common is to determine if Submodule or group should be displayed in the application. The second purpose is to attach them to actions. When attached to actions the conditional determines if that action should be fired (i.e. setting an input group variable to a default value if a certain output group variable is selected).

*** Submodule/Group Conditionals

To find a conditional that controls if a submodule or group are hidden:
1. Navigate to the submodule or group entity page and expand the "Conditionals" accordion

#+ATTR_LATEX: :placement [H]
#+CAPTION: VMS: Conditionals to only show the Spot(input) submodule if either these output variables are selected. NOTE: Clicking "Edit" on the conditional will populate the form on the right. This is usefull to see where this group variable belongs and not just it's module and name. (i.e. The conditional above belongs to the Surface (Module) \to Spot Output (Submodule) \to Maximum Spotting Distance (group).

*** Action Conditionals

To find a conditional attached to an action:
1. Navigate to the Group Variable entity page and expand the "Actions" accordion

* Updating Text

Most texts for entities displayed in the application can be updated by changing the translation field for that entity..These entities will have 2 translation fields. One field is used in the worksheet wizard (pages before computation) and the second is used for the results page. Usually the result translations are a short form of the worksheet translations. Here are some of the common entities you might want to update. The application will default to the worksheet translation if a result translation is not present.

** Submodule/Group/Group-Variables

1. For these entities navigate to the entity page, see [[*Modules/Submodules/Groups/Group Variables][Modules/Submodules/Groups/Group Variables]] section.
2. Update the "Translation" field.

* Updating Units Dropdown Selections

In the Application's inputs page a user can change units via a drop down menu. By default a variable is linked to a "Dimension" (i.e. length) and will have all options available to select. However there are cases when this list should be limited to a subset. If this is desired do the following:

1. Find the Domain associated with the variable you are interested in. See [[*Variable Domains Associated with a Group Variable][Variable Domains Associated with a Group Variable]] section.
2. Click "Edit" on the Domain set
3. Click "Edit" on the Domain found in step 1.
4. Under "Filtered Units" select a subset of your desired units

#+CAPTION: VMS: Domains Page Updating Units drop down to a subset of units.
[[./images/vms-guide/Screenshot 2025-04-16 163044.png]]

* Re-Ordering

Certain entities can be re-ordered via the VMS. To do this:

1. Find the parent entity of the entity you are trying to reorder (i.e. Need to reorder groups? find the submodule entity page. Need to reorder a list options? Find the List entity page.). See  [[*Finding VMS elements in the Application][Finding VMS elements in the Application]]
2. Once you're on that page there should be a table that have a list of entities for you to reorder. Click on the "up" and "down" buttons to reorder
